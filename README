NAME
    Markup::MatchTree - For building trees to be compared to
    "Markup::Tree"s.

SYNOPSIS
            use Markup::MatchTree;

            my $match_tree = Markup::MatchTree->new( no_squash_whitespace => \@same_as_I_used_for_Markup__Tree);
            $match_tree->parse_file ('http://localhost/site_template.xml');

DESCRIPTION
    Most likely you won't need to use this module explicitly unless you are
    doing some custom matching/parsing/extracting. Mainly this will be used
    by the upcoming Markup::Content module.

    See Markup::Tree for a description of the methods. The only difference
    is "MatchTree" dosen't accpet "no_indent" as an argument.
    "no_squash_whitespace" should be the same value that was used for
    "Markup::Tree".
